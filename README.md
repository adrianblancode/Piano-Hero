Piano Hero
==========

## Warning!!!

This code is objectively terrible, it was written in early 2011 while I was still in high school and barely knew how to program. It was only uploaded to GitHub in order to be preserved for future generation as an example of how hard work and hope is no substitute for actual knowledge. 

## Features

Piano Hero is a Guitar Hero clone for piano. It supports both MIDI input (for example to connect a MIDI keyboard to it), and technically any song to play as long as it's in a .midi or .mid format. The notes of the song will scroll down on the screen, and the user recieves a score on how well he/she plays.

This program was written entirely in C, using Allegro for graphics, FMOD for sound and WinMM for MIDI input. If anyone for any reason would want to try it out (please dont), you can execute the program by running pianohero.exe. On the title screen you can enter the name of one of the preselected tracks, such as "Moonlight Sonata" or "Dragonforce" and hopefully become a piano hero.
